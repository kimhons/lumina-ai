### Integration with Existing Architecture

The end-user module will integrate with the existing Lumina AI architecture:

1. **Core UI Framework**: Reuse the responsive design system, theme management, and accessibility features
2. **Agent Visualization**: Simplified version of the agent visualization for end-users
3. **Configuration**: User-specific preferences connected to the main configuration system
4. **Monitoring**: Limited access to relevant performance metrics
5. **Integration**: Streamlined connections to external tools and data sources

### Data Flow

1. User input → Input processing → Agent selection → Processing → Response generation → Enhanced display
2. Workspace data ↔ Persistent storage ↔ Collaboration system
3. User preferences → Configuration system
4. Tool requests → Integration system → External services → Results display

## Unique Features

### Visual Thinking

The Visual Thinking feature will visualize the AI's reasoning process:

1. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**: Visual representation of logical steps
2. **Decision Trees**: Visualization of decision points and alternatives
3. **Knowledge Graphs**: Showing connections between concepts
4. **Confidence Indicators**: Visual representation of confidence in different paths

### Adaptive Interface

The interface will adapt to user behavior and preferences:

1. **Skill-Level Adaptation**: Adjusts complexity based on user expertise
2. **Context-Aware Layout**: Reorganizes based on current task
3. **Personalized Suggestions**: Learns from user interactions to suggest relevant tools
4. **Accessibility Adaptations**: Automatically adjusts for accessibility needs

### Enhanced Collaboration

Advanced collaboration features beyond simple sharing:

1. **Real-Time Co-Editing**: Multiple users can interact simultaneously
2. **Role-Based Collaboration**: Different permissions and capabilities
3. **Annotation System**: Comment on specific parts of AI responses
4. **Version History**: Track changes and restore previous versions
5. **Collaborative Prompting**: Multiple users can contribute to complex prompts
