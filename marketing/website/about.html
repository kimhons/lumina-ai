                        <h3>The Beginning</h3>
                        <p>Lumina AI was founded by a team of AI researchers, enterprise software engineers, and industry experts who recognized a fundamental limitation in existing AI systems: while individual AI models were becoming increasingly powerful, they operated in isolation, unable to collaborate effectively to solve complex, multi-faceted problems.</p>
                        <p>Our founding team set out to create a new paradigm for enterprise AIâ€”one built on collaboration, specialization, and orchestration.</p>

                        <h3>Early Innovation</h3>
                        <p>After months of research and development, we launched our first prototype of the multi-agent collaboration system. This early version demonstrated the power of specialized agents working together, with each agent contributing its unique capabilities to solve problems that none could handle alone.</p>
                        <p>We partnered with select organizations across financial services, healthcare, and manufacturing to refine our approach and prove the value of collaborative AI in real-world scenarios.</p>
