   - Extend the existing API Gateway to route end-user requests appropriately
   - Implement versioning to support both old and new interface patterns

2. **Database Schema Evolution**
   - Add new tables/collections without modifying existing schemas
   - Create views that unify data access across old and new components

3. **Service Mesh Implementation**
   - Deploy service mesh architecture to manage communication between components
   - Implement circuit breakers and fallbacks for resilience

### Phase 3: Controlled Rollout (Weeks 7-8)
1. **Beta Testing Program**
   - Select a small group of users for initial access
   - Collect feedback and metrics on system performance

2. **Gradual Feature Activation**
   - Enable features progressively using feature flags
   - Monitor system performance at each stage

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**
